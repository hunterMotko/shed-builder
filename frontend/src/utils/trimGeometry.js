 * Model bundle and stays in the components — but a corner board is a corner
 * board on both, and both ask here for it.
 *
 * Everything is in shed space, the same space the walls are placed in: the
 * outer face of the front siding is at `+length / 2`, of the right siding at
 * `+width / 2`, and the floor is y = 0.
